Description: Supervised machine learning has an increasingly important role in biological
    studies. However, the sheer complexity of classification pipelines poses a significant
    barrier to the expert biologist unfamiliar with machine learning. Moreover,
    many biologists lack the time or technical skills necessary to establish their own
    pipelines. This package introduces a framework for the rapid implementation of
    high-throughput supervised machine learning built with the biologist user in mind.
    Written by biologists, for biologists, this package provides a user-friendly interface
    that empowers investigators to execute state-of-the-art binary and multi-class
    classification, including deep learning, with minimal programming
    experience necessary.
