\usage{
buildDNN(object, top = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{ExprsArray} object. The training set.}

\item{top}{A numeric scalar or character vector. A numeric scalar indicates
the number of top features that should undergo feature selection. A character vector
indicates specifically which features by name should undergo feature selection.
Set \code{top = 0} to include all features. A numeric vector can also be used
to indicate specific features by location, similar to a character vector.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to the detailed function.}
}
\value{
Returns an \code{ExprsModel} object.
}
\description{
\code{buildDNN} builds a model using the \code{h2o.deeplearning} function
 from the \code{h2o} package.
