The \code{exprso} package includes these feature selection modules:

- \code{\link{fsSample}}

- \code{\link{fsNULL}}

- \code{\link{fsANOVA}}

- \code{\link{fsInclude}}

- \code{\link{fsStats}}

- \code{\link{fsPrcomp}}

- \code{\link{fsEbayes}}

- \code{\link{fsMrmre}}

- \code{\link{fsPropd}}

\details{
Considering the high-dimensionality of most genomic datasets, it is prudent and often necessary
 to prioritize which features to include during classifier construction. Although there exists
 many feature selection methods, this package provides wrappers for some of the most popular ones.
 Each wrapper (1) pre-processes the \code{ExprsArray} input, (2) performs the feature selection,
 and (3) returns an \code{ExprsArray} output with an updated feature selection history.
 You can use, in tandem, any number of feature selection methods, and in any order.

For all feature selection methods, \code{@preFilter} and \code{@reductionModel} stores the
 feature selection and dimension reduction history, respectively. This history gets passed
 along to prepare the test or validation set during model deployment, ensuring that these
 sets undergo the same feature selection and dimension reduction as the training set.

Under the scenarios where users plan to apply multiple feature selection or dimension
 reduction steps, the \code{top} argument manages which features (e.g., gene expression values)
 to send through each feature selection or dimension reduction procedure. For \code{top},
 a numeric scalar indicates the number of top features to use, while a character vector
 indicates specifically which features to use. In this way, the user sets which features
 to feed INTO the \code{fs} method (NOT which features the user expects OUT). The example
 below shows how to apply dimension reduction to the top 50 features as selected by the
 Student's t-test. Set \code{top = 0} to pass all features through an \code{fs} method.

Note that not all feature selection methods will generalize to multi-class data.
 A feature selection method will fail when applied to an \code{ExprsMulti} object
 unless that feature selection method has an \code{ExprsMulti} method.
