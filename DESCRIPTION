Description: Supervised machine learning has an increasingly important role in data
    analysis. This package introduces a framework for rapidly implementing supervised
    machine learning in a high-throughput manner. This package provides a user-friendly
    interface that empowers investigators to execute state-of-the-art binary and
    multi-class classification, including deep learning, with minimal programming
    experience necessary.
